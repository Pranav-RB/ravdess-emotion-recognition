# Emotion recognition from speech (RAVDESS)

## Overview
CNN-based speech emotion classifier trained on MFCCs extracted from RAVDESS. This was a project for my Deep Learning class

## Usage
1. Download the [RAVDESS](https://zenodo.org/records/1188976) dataset and place it into `RAVDESS/` (or run download script).
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

## Features
Currently, it can only predict the emotion from the speech audio file. Future plans include, predicting the emotion and intensity as a multi-label classification.
